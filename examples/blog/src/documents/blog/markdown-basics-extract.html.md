Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

### Header 3

> This is a blockquote.
> 
> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.
>
> ## This is an H2 in a blockquote

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.
*   Candy.
*   Gum.
*   Booze.
+   Candy.
+   Gum.
+   Booze.
-   Candy.
-   Gum.
-   Booze.
1.  Red
2.  Green
3.  Blue
*   A list item.

    With multiple paragraphs.

*   Another item in the list.
This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").
I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

[2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
[3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"
I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
[The New York Times][NY Times].
